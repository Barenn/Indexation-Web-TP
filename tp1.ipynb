      "British Airways Plc (BA) on Wednesday boosted its position in France when French bank Rivaud joined its bid for ailing French regional airline Air Liberte.\n",
      "Rivaud, a founding shareholder in Air Liberte and a former partner in a rival consortium, agreed with BA after marathon talks started on Tuesday afternoon and ending at this morning.\n",
      "It is the only bid left on the table and the commercial court in Creteil is expected to approve the offer on Friday. Richard Branson's Brussels-based Virgin Express and commercial pilot Fernand Denan had also been working on takeover offers.\n",
      "The BA/Rivaud proposal still needs the blessing of Air Liberte's creditors and French political authorities.\n",
      "Air Liberte has a 12 percent stake of the domestic French market and BA's TAT unit eight percent. The market is still dominated by the state-owned Air France group.\n",
      "\"The situation is delicate,\" said Mark Rochet, chairman of TAT, adding he hoped the court would take a quick decision.\n",
      "\"Our partnership with the Groupe Rivaud offers the ideal solution for Air Liberte's very poor financial position. To save it requires quick action,\" BA chief executive Robert Ayling said in a statement.\n",
      "\"It's an excellent solution. We keep all the assets. I do not see another French solution, the last deadline was Friday,\" Air Liberte founder and chairman Lotfi Belhassine told Reuters.\n",
      "British Airways will make a 440 million franc ($85.3 million) equity investment for a 70 percent stake in Air Liberte and Rivaud will put up 190 million for the remaining 30 percent. On top of that Rivaud will make a write down on 500 million francs of its old stake and also on some 60 million francs in loan stocks.\n",
      "Both companies will pay the costs of running Air Liberte during administration, estimated at 150 million francs.\n",
      "Rochet told a news conference Air Liberte's debt now stands at 800 million francs. Creditors can either get 20 percent of their money in cash or get fully paid over 10 years.\n",
      "Rivaud, headed by industrialist Vincent Bollore, had originally been part of a consortium of travel groups Nouvelles Frontieres, Club Mediterannee and Royal Air Maroc.\n",
      "Nouvelles Frontieres chairman Jacques Maillot said he and the Moroccan airline had withdrawn because of the \"extraordinary disastrous financial situation\" of Air Liberte.\n",
      "Bollore is chairman of a shipping and financial group with his name. He was made the chairman of Rivaud last week and the bank is increasing its capital especially for Air Liberte.\n",
      "A Bollore official said Rivaud had changed camps on Tuesday after Nouvelles Frontieres and other partners said they were unwilling to stump up the money needed for a two-third stake.\n",
      "Rivaud, Club Med and airplane leasing company ILFC were among the original backers of Air Liberte eight years ago.\n",
      "The BA/Rivaud plan is based on the three-year business plan for Air Liberte drawn up by BA. It will safeguard 1,250 out of 1,400 Air Liberte jobs and aims for break-even in 1999.\n",
      "Belhassine will continue to run Air Liberte which owns about a quarter of the landing and take-off slots at Orly airport, Paris' second airport specialising in domestic flights.\n",
      "It lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 due to an air fare war and insufficient passenger numbers in the run-up to full liberalisation of French airspace in 1997. ($1=5.157 French Franc)\n",

      "A fast-selling product that allows grannies all across America to exchange electronic mail securely with their families may become a key weapon in challenging the U.S. government's tight encryption policies.\n",
      "Computer industry executives said the strong encryption which startup USWeb Networks is delivering on hundreds of thousands of television-based Internet browsing devices is still prohibited from export by U.S. Cold War munitions laws.\n",
      "Executives at Palo Alto, Calif.-based WebTV said they chose to use the strongest coding standard available to give consumers the assurance their communications would be kept confidential.\n",
      "\"The only way we felt we could guarantee the level of security we felt was uncrackable by anyone...was if we were essentially using CIA-class security procedures,\" said Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV Networks.\n",
      "WebTV uses 128-bit encryption, based on coded 'keys' with 128 characters of information, the same level of coding used in some of the most secretive U.S. government communications.\n",
      "\"It's very similar to what they use when they're communicating with cruise missiles,\" Perlman said.\n",
      "This is a useful fact to point out in reassuring potential customers they can both communicate and pay for goods and services securely over the Internet, he added.\n",
      "\"They love it. They really love it, beause now they can just relax and forget about it,\" he said. Using a credit card number over WebTV's encrypted communications is safer than reading it over a telephone, which can be tapped, he argues.\n",
      "\"While the FBI can get your credit card that way (over the telephone), they can't get it through WebTV,\" he said.\n",
      "Perhaps equally excited about the decision by WebTV to use such strong encryption is the Silicon Valley high tech business community, which has been deadlocked in a battle with the Clinton administration over encryption restrictions.\n",
      "Laws against the export of encryption date back to the start of the Cold War, when earlier versions of coding were considered vital to national security and were classified as munitions explicitly barred from export.\n",
      "Top computer executives now say the use of encryption in relatively normal, consumer-oriented applications such as WebTV is a perfect example why they feel the government's efforts to restrict the technology should ultimately fail.\n",
      "\"Without commenting specifically on WebTV, I can tell you that the government is fighting essentially a losing battle here,\" said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems Inc.\n",
      "\"What's happened is that the technology is now so ubiquitous and there are so many people using it that the current law...really needs to be scrapped.\"\n",
      "In addition to the need for U.S. businesses to have strong encryption to secure their own systems when operating overseas, the computer industry argues that competitors in other countries are being given an open market to sell higher levels of encryption U.S. companies are barred from selling.\n",
      "But Washington insists that law enforcement authorities must have a means of breaking into encoded messages to investigate criminal activity.\n",
      "The Administration recently offered a compromise where companies could export modestly strong 'keys,' less powerful than those used by WebTV, as long as they could be recovered by authorities to crack codes after obtaining a court warrant.\n",
      "Industry is not pleased with the idea.\n",
      "It would be difficult, and unduly expensive, to administer and is unlikely to be acceptable to foreign customers who might not consider the U.S. government to have a right to break into their confidential communications, many argue.\n",
      "\"Our personal view is that the notion of key recovery is something that's not going to be very acceptable, particularly to other countries -- the notion that the U.S. government would be able to recover the keys,\" said Deborah Triant, chief executive of Check Point Software Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "In the meantime, however, WebTV will be prohibited except by special license from exporting its devices, which are being sold by consumer electronics manufacturers Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV through retail stores.\n",
      "In fact, the issue came to light publicly following a letter from one of the manufacturers to its distributors, warning not to export the machines due to the munitions laws.\n",
      "\"It would definitely be unfortunate if sombedy was to carry one over the border,\" said Perlman, adding the WebTV boxes have more computing power than the world's most powerful supercomputer -- Cray Reasearch's XMP-48 -- did in 1987.\n",
      "\"That was a $50 million computer in 1987. This is a $300 computer and it outperforms the Cray,\" he said.\n",
      "WebTV has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp. and a unit of US West Inc..\n",
      "\"This WebTV is the first of many we're going to see where legitimate customers really do need very strong encryption for things involving really normal day-to-day use,\" said Schmidt.\n",

      "State-owned Air France on Wednesday reported dramatically improved earnings of 802 million francs ($158 million) in the first half and placed a bumper order for 20 Boeing and Airbus aircraft, plus options.\n",
      "The profit estimate for the six months to September 30, which emerged in an Air France board statement, compared with a loss of 335 million francs a year ago.\n",
      "The improved results and Air France's aim to break even in 1996/97 was underlined with orders for 10 Boeing 777 twinjets, and options for 10 more. The airline also ordered five Airbus A340s, confirmed five orders made in June and options for a further five.\n",
      "Air France chairman Christian Blanc won vital support from Prime Minister Alain Juppe to buy from Seattle-based Boeing instead of ordering solely from its archrival Airbus Industrie , the European consortium based in southwest France.\n",
      "At catalogue prices, which are rarely paid, the orders and options for the Boeing 777-200 version ordered could be worth around $2.7 billion. Airbus would stand to gain $1.75 billion.\n",
      "List prices for the B777-200 range between $128 and $146 million, while the Airbus A340-300 costs $110 to $120 million.\n",
      "\"In the reorganisation of its fleet, Air France is obliged to buy Boeing,\" Transport Minister Bernard Pons told parliament.\n",
      "\"It is obliged to meet commitments made in 1989, unless it accepts losing deposits and taking legal action which risks being much more expensive than taking this decision.\"\n",
      "The French airline had orders outstanding with Boeing worth $994 million and $2 billion of options, Pons said, adding that the airline had skillfully negotiated the latest order to respect the initial undertaking.\n",
      "The three state representatives on the Air France board approved the Boeing 777 purchase \"not because they are the best or the most profitable but because they best meet the company's needs,\" Pons said.\n",
      "Air France had also accepted to be a launch customer for the planned A340-600, a \"stretched\" version of the A340, he said.\n",
      "Airbus hopes to build the 375-seater to smash Boeing's monopoly at the large capacity aircraft segment.\n",
      "Air France said that due to financial problems, it froze at the end of 1994 all aircraft orders, including the 1989 Boeing order, and opened talks with the two plane-makers.\n",
      "Air France has since rationalised its fleet, restructured its network around a centralised \"hub\" at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport and optimised aircraft use. It has over the past two years increased the number of flying hours by 14 percent.\n",
      "Pons welcomed Air France's financial results, saying: \"The results are very encouraging.\"\n",
      "The company said it made its profit despite a rise in spending on fuel of nearly 500 million francs for the period.\n",
      "Turnover was up nearly five percent to 21.3 billion francs due to a 14.8 percent increase in passenger traffic and a 6.7 percent rise in freight.\n",
      "Operating profit rose nearly 30 percent to 1.1 billion francs, compared with 849 million in the year-earlier period. The pretax, pre-exceptional result tripled to 660 million francs.\n",
      "Air France was ahead by \"a little more than 250 million francs of its budget\" at the six months stage, the company said. The first half is traditionally better for seasonal reasons and should not be used to extrapolate for the full year, it added.\n",
      "Debt stood at 12.9 billion francs at September 30, versus 19.2 billion at March 31, 1996. The repayment of 6.3 billion francs significantly exceeded the last tranche of its state recapitalisation paid in September.\n",
      "The Boeing order consists of the heavier \"Increased Gross Weight\" version of the basic 777-200, equipped with GE90 engines built by General Electric and France's Snecma. The B777-200 will seat 288 passengers in three-classes.\n",
      "The Airbus order is for the A340-200E version equipped with CFM56-5C4 engines. ($1=5.075 French Franc)\n",
